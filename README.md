# Beatsync

Beatsync is an open-source, cloud-native platform for **perfect audio synchronization** and **spatial audio** across independent devices, all in the browser.

### Quickstart

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

Fill in the `.env` file in `apps/client` with the following:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

Run the following commands to start the server and client:

```sh
bun install          # installs once for all workspaces
bun dev              # starts both client (:3000) and server (:8080)
```
